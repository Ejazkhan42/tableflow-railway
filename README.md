# Tableflow - Railway Template
This example template to deploy a self-hosted version of [Tableflow](https://tableflow.com/). 

**IMPORTANT**: This repository is fork of [Tableflow](https://github.com/tableflowhq/tableflow)'s official Repository. Since Tableflow code   doesn't support path based routing for admin-ui and viewer-ui we have added nginx configuration to support path based routing.
